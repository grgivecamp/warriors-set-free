												Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in Yahweh's law.
												On his law he meditates day and night.
												He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither.
